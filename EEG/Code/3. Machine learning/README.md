# Note
This specific notebook had some problems. At first we though we had a memory leakage problem because each time we ran the whole code it became slightly less efficent. If i ran it enough times my computer suddenly crashed and restarted.
If you experience this same issue, you will need to quit jupyter, quit the terminal and reopen everything before each run. If you know anything about how to solve this issue, please let me know by sending me an email to javi@ciencias.unam.mx. 
It might have been a problem related to my computer. I used a MacBook Air Early 2015(sheesh, I need to upgrade my computer) with macOS Monterrey version 12.5.1 and Python 3.8.5. 

Thank you for using my code, I hope you still find it very usefull and sorry for the inconvenience.
